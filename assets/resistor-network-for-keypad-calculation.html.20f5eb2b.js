In this section, I will explain my observations from the code; feel free to skip it if you have already read the links above.</p><p>The tool applies a brute-force approach to evaluate the resistor values, to find the maximum of the smallest gaps across various resistor combinations. and there is no limit in the source code for cases where resistors have equal values. For example, when <code>d</code> and <code>e</code> are equal, it is impossible to determine whether switch <code>S2</code> or switch <code>S5</code> is pressed. Similarly, you cannot use a resistor value in the columns if it has already been used in the rows. Please remember that <code>a</code> is not either the column resistor or the row resistor.</p><br><p align="center"><img src="'+l+'"></p><p>In the image above, when the <code>S16</code> switch is pressed the analog value connects to GND and the minimum value corresponds to this switch. The highest value is when all resistors (<code>a</code> is always in the path) are in the path which means the <code>S1</code> switch is pressed.</p><p>At first glance the minimmum gap for the ADC values is where the smallest resistor in the network comes to the path when all other resistors in the other side are already in the path. The resistors are shown in the image below. But literally the minimum gap can be because of adding/removing a column resistor to/from the path and removing/adding another row resistor in a way that the value difference was small, in this case the gap would be small if the <code>a</code> resistor is big enough.</p><p align="center"><img src="'+c+'"></p><p>I have also gathered insights from previous work, such as the limitations of the ADC sampling rate due to output impedance. Additionally, you can multiply the values by a consistent factor. Now we can go further and implement the calculator.</p><h2 id="implementation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Implementation</h2><p>I have used the genetic algorithm to solve the problem, this can significantly improve the time efficiency, but it comes with caveats regarding precision and convergence. It guarantees that the final result is close enough to the exact solution but it may not be the solution you looking for. I also performed some tests on it and I figured out it may require thousands of generations to achieve a slight improvement in the best answer.</p>',12),x=t("You can find my code in "),S={href:"https://github.com/the-this-pointer/resistor-network-calculator",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T=t("this Github repository");function N(B,L){const o=h("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),n("div",null,[m,u,p,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[e("a",f,[w,i(o)]),_,g,b]),e("li",null,[e("a",v,[y,i(o)]),I])]),k,e("p",null,[x,e("a",S,[T,i(o)])])])}var C=a(d,[["render",N],["__file","resistor-network-for-keypad-calculation.html.vue"]]);export{C as default};
